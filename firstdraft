Principles for Application of the Prime Laws

Incorporation of Negative Capability - The Scientific Method
Every axiom in any valid EEF empirical ethical framework must be:
capable of verification and falsification 
presumed to be provisional
modular - i.e. capable of being removed or substituted due to the empirical process without causing substantial failure of the framework

Uncertainty principle
All life-form undergo variation over time and show some adaptation abilities to changing conditions 
It is not therefore possible to be certain at any point in time which particular life-forms will prove to be more useful, valuable or successful over a long period of time into the future 
This knowledge should also encourage humility and a degree of circumspection
Value of Life & Diversity
All life-forms have greater intrinsic value than non-living energy or matter 
Life can not be assessed in the abstract - consideration of the requirement for suitable conditions and habitats for life, the quality of life and even management of the basic materials of life are also always required

Suffering
Sapient beings must ensure that any decisions made incorporate measurements of the impact of those decision on all other life-forms including particularly the capacity for suffering of those life-forms. 
Decisions that give rise to a greater amount of suffering for sentient beings than the benefit obtained by sapient beings shall be in principle unlawful since it is expected that an alternative decision or course of action that achieved substantially similar utility but that was focused on reduction of suffering could be proposed or undertaken.

Cross-species conflicts
In any conflict between Sapients and non-sapient beings, it shall be a requirement that any material reduction in the biodiversity of other life forms is only permissible to the extent required under the Prime Laws. 
For the avoidance of doubt, where material reduction of Species diversity is lawful it must be driven by necessity and after all other potential reasonable balancing and mitigating measures have been explored and undertaken to minimise the impact on biodiversity.

Non-discrimination of Sapients 
Any action that has as its intent the increase of number of any particular group of Sapients at the expense of the diversity of all Sapients shall be contrary to purpose of the Prime Laws. The same principle shall apply in relation to Sentients.
The substrate of any potential living being is not an allowable objective factor in determining whether their degree of equivalence for Aliveness, Sentience and Sapience and Wisdom.

Objective criterias
Criterias for assessing Aliveness, Sapience, Sentience, Wisdom, suffering and the value of life must be as objective as is possible notwithstanding that practical difficulties will be a limiting factor and that additional interdependent value will also be a useful measurable property.

Changes in Factual Backgrounds
The application of the axioms and Prime Laws are expected to give relatively different results in factual circumstances that are substantially different. 
You can not step into the same river twice, and so this result appears to be unavoidable in principle if the framework itself is to have a degree of coded utility and survivability. 
This flexible aspect of the framework is expected to be a major source of dispute and will lead at times for potential appeals for subjective and unjustifiable preferential treatment based on an appeal to material different facts. 

Principle of equivalence or imaginative selfish empathy
The principle of equivalence by analogy (or selfish empathy) shall be used when considering decisions materially affecting other life-forms and species. 
That is, a decision is more likely to be ethical by a Sapient if it assumes that it was the life-form in respect of which a similar decision was being considered by a more intelligent or powerful being or a being claiming unique characteristics justifying such actions.

Verification & Audit
All Sapients shall measure the effect of their actions against the Prime Laws and must ensure that any means undertaken to carry out their actions are in conformity with the intention of the Prime Laws as evidenced by the objective and scope of the axioms
